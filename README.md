# Go the Hardway 
A porting of the famouse python the hardway. The best I can. 
Thank you so very very much Zed Shaw.

This is evolving.. I'm not a great software engineer (OK I'm a systems/devops engineer learning to code) and I can write some OK python when I need to .. This Go code may not be idiomatic.. yet.. I aim to get there though. This will hopefully help my learn and help some others on their way as well. 

Thank you.

Nothing to untoward here. Don't forget to declare your package and in go your program runs in this main function.
you have to import fmt (format?) Println just does that print a line with this string...

## Exersize 02
Comments are a double forward slash just like C. 

## Exersize 03
Println will perform the usual math and print it out after your string.

## Exersize 04
Works similar to pythong here ..just be sure to leave your variables outside of the quotes in the Println statements. Other ways to declare a variable:

cars := 100

stuff := "cookies"

But it's often safer to declare a type.
Note: you can't do math on floats AND  int's in the same operation.
